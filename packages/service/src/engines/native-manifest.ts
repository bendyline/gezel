/**
 * Source-pinned root of trust for runtime engine downloads.
 *
 * The daemon can download native engine binaries (`llama-server`, …) on
 * demand from the `native-v<version>` GitHub release (see
 * `resolver.ts`). To make the *published gezel package* the trust anchor
 * — rather than blindly trusting whatever the release happens to contain
 * — we bake in two values per build:
 *
 *   - `NATIVE_ENGINE_RELEASE`  the release version this build resolves
 *     against (the `native-v<X>` tag, minus the prefix).
 *   - `SHA256SUMS_DIGEST`      the sha256 of that release's `SHA256SUMS`
 *     asset. The resolver verifies the downloaded `SHA256SUMS` file
 *     against this digest BEFORE trusting any per-asset hash inside it,
 *     then verifies each downloaded archive against its line in
 *     `SHA256SUMS`. A tampered release can't swap a binary without
 *     failing the baked-in digest.
 *
 * This mirrors the `NODE_SHA256` pin in
 * [node-version.ts](../../../app/src/node-version.ts): a placeholder of
 * all-zeros means "no public release pinned yet" and the resolver
 * refuses to download (rather than trusting an unverifiable release).
 *
 * Bumping: when a `native-v<X>` release is cut, set both constants (the
 * digest is `sha256(SHA256SUMS)` of that release). Never hand-edit the
 * digest to match a download — that defeats the point.
 *
 * Dev/integration override: set `GEZEL_NATIVE_ENGINE_VERSION` to point at
 * a real dev release before the public pin exists. With the digest still
 * a placeholder the resolver runs in "unpinned" mode — it verifies each
 * archive against the release's own `SHA256SUMS` (catching corruption)
 * but logs that it could not anchor to a baked-in digest.
